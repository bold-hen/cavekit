# Implementation Tracking: Build Lifecycle
| Task | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| T-004 | DONE | Added auto-merge of main into worktree branch in setup-build.sh when reusing existing worktree |
| T-005 | DONE | Merge conflict handling included in T-004 (abort merge, report conflicts, show 3 options, exit 1) |
| T-006 | DONE | Merge result logging included in T-004 (up-to-date or merged with output summary) |
| T-007 | DONE | Forward .env* files via symlinks on worktree creation and reuse |
| T-008 | DONE | Symlink verification runs on every build start — broken symlinks are re-created |
| T-011 | DONE | Recovery detection on build start (surfaces branch, last commit, diff stats). Resume proceeds through merge+env. --abandon flag for cleanup. |
| T-012 | DONE | --abandon flag removes worktree (force), prunes, deletes branch |
| T-013 | DONE | Resume flow cleans stale ralph-loop state then proceeds through normal merge (R1) + env verify (R2) path |
